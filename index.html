            I'm a Computer Science student at the University of Central Florida, expected to graduate in August 2024.
            I've been programming since 2016. Since then, I've made many games and applications, and have even worked
            contracting positions for
            <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.dissiax.com/">a startup company</a>,
            and multiple studios

            I am currently working on my Senior Design project and finalizing my tenure at UCF. I'm more interested than
            ever in Software Development
            now that I'll have a degree. I am passionate about Fullstack Development, and I enjoy learning new
            technologies and honing my skills
            on the things I already know. I hope to be able to apply my skills and begin my career as soon as possible!
